what is primitive obsession?
it's an anti-pattern where you're using primitive types to represent complex values in your domain
ex:
using primitive types to represent entity identifiers such as Guid or int
- a popular solution for solving primitive obsession with entity identifiers is using strongly typed Ids
- we have to ensure that our class is strongly typed ,immutable and support structural equality so we can use records instead of classes as they support all of these things.
- we can use third party lib like StronglyTypedId by androw lock.

hints:
anti-pattern:means that is commonly used and are not efficient or backfires on our technical proccesses.
