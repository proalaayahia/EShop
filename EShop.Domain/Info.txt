what is primitive obsession?
it's an anti-pattern where you're using primitive types to represent complex values in your domain
ex:
using primitive types to represent entity identifiers such as Guid or int
- a popular solution for solving primitive obsession with entity identifiers is using strongly typed Ids
- we have to ensure that our class is strongly typed ,immutable and support structural equality so we can use records instead of classes as they support all of these things.
- we can use third party lib like StronglyTypedId by androw lock.

to map our rich domain models to database with its aggregates and value objects we have to add our configurations for each aggregate in our domain assembly.

Domain Events are records of something that has already occured in our system
for example when we create order then we have
- OrderCreatedDomainEvent

hints:
anti-pattern:means that is commonly used and are not efficient or backfires on our technical proccesses.
